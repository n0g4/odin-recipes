            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <h3>FOR THE TURKEY SAUSAGE</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl add the turkey and all of the seasonings and brown sugar. Mix thoroughly to incorporate into the meat.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet over medium high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and add in the turkey. Brown it on both sides and cook it until no pink color remains.</li>
                <li>Break up the sausage into small pieces and set aside until you are ready for it later.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>FOR THE BURRITO FILLING</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>While the turkey is cooking, wash and prep all of your vegetables.</li>
                <li>Cut the peppers and onion into a small dice and roughly chop the spinach into smaller pieces. Measure out 2 cups of frozen shredded hash browns.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet over medium high heat add 1 tbsp of oil and add in the peppers and onions. Allow them to cook down and soften. Season lightly with salt early to help encourage some of the water to be released faster.</li>
                <li>Once the onions have begun to turn translucent, add in the hash browns and spinach. Stir to combine and wilt the spinach.</li>
                <li>Crack 8 eggs into a bowl, add in 2 tbsp of milk and beat until they are smooth.</li>
                <li>You can cook the eggs in the same skillet or in a separate one at the same time as the vegetables cook. If you use the same skillet, create some room in the center to cook the eggs.</li>
                <li>Add in 1 tbsp of oil and pour the eggs into the center to make scrambled eggs. Cook them for a few minutes until they have finished.</li>
                <li>Once done, remove from the heat and stir in the sausage. Mix and give it a taste test. Adjust flavor with salt and pepper as necessary.</li>
                <li>Allow the mixture to cool before you construct the burritos, put it in the fridge for a few minutes if necessary.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>CONSTRUCTING THE BURRITOS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I made 17 burritos out of this recipe using 9 inch tortillas. You may yield more or less./li>
                <li>Measure out 1 cup (120g) of shredded cheese.</li>
                <li>Lay out some tortillas on your work space and place a couple of large spoonfuls of the filling on top of each. I used about 70-80g of filling for each burrito.</li>
                <li>Add about 1 tbsp of shredded cheese to the top of the filling and roll the burrito up by folding in the sides first, then rolling the center over the top. Repeat until all of your filling is used up.</li>
                <li>If you are going to vacuum seal these, place the burritos onto a sheet pan or in a baking dish as you finish them. Flash freeze the burritos by placing them into your freezer, uncovered, for a few hours until they are frozen solid. If you don't plan on vacuum sealing you can just roll them in foil or place them in a zip top bag.</li>
                <li>Once the burritos have frozen solid, place them into your vacuum bags and remove the air. Store in your freezer.            </li>
            </ol>
